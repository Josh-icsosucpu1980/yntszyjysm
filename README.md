# Pabrik Gula - Chronicle of Threads

## Foreword by the Head Costumer

Working on "Pabrik Gula" was not just a project; it felt like unearthing history, stitch by painstaking stitch. For decades, I've dressed stories in fabric and thread, bringing characters to life from the outside in. But this film... this factory... it seeped into the very fibers we touched. This document is less a collection of design notes and more a testimony to the weight each costume carried. There's a sadness inherent in the walls of that place, and we did our best to weave it into every garment. It was a quiet, heavy process.

## The Setting's Grasp on the Wardrobe

The "Pabrik Gula" itself dictated much of our approach. It wasn't just a backdrop; it was a character â€“ oppressive, demanding, and ultimately, decaying. The costumes had to feel like they belonged entirely to this environment, worn down and marked by its relentless presence.

### A Palette of Weariness

We deliberately restricted our palette. Forget vibrant hues. The dominant colors were born from dust, sweat, stale sugar, and the slow fade of sunlight through grimy windows.

   Sugar Dust White: Never clean. Always slightly yellowed, granular, clinging. It represented the product, yes, but also the pervasive nature of the work. It gets into everything, stains everything.
   Industrial Greys and Browns: The color of unwashed canvas, rusted metal, dried mud, and endless labor. Monolithic and without hope.
   Faded Blues and Greens: Remnants of once brighter fabrics, perhaps from a different life or a garment passed down. Now muted, washed out, like faded memories.
   Occasional, Bleeding Reds: Not vibrant. The color of old rust, or something darker, more human, that couldn't quite be scrubbed away. Used sparingly for impact, suggesting injury or desperation.

### Fabrics That Spoke of Hardship

Texture was paramount. We sourced and treated fabrics to feel rough, worn, and lived-in â€“ not just aged for the camera, but possessing a believable history of strain and repair.

   Coarse Cottons and Linens: For the workers. Easily stained, quick to absorb sweat, prone to tearing and requiring constant, visible patching. Every patch told a story of necessity, not embellishment.
   Heavy Drills and Canvas: Used for work aprons and utility clothing. Stiff, unyielding, offering minimal comfort but a sense of protection against a brutal environment. Impregnated with residue.
   Faded, Thin Wool: For slightly warmer garments, showing pilling and loss of structure. Felt scratchy and offered little real warmth, reflecting inadequate provision.
   Tarnished Silks and Weighted Brocades: For the managerial or owning class, but always with a caveat. Never pristine. Slightly soiled hems, loosened threads, colors that seemed a little off. Their opulence was presented as something bought at a cost, something slightly decaying from within, mirroring the rot of their privilege.

## Characters Clothed in Their Burdens

Each character's costume was designed not just to fit the period, but to carry the weight of their individual sorrow and struggle within the factory's confines.

### The Overseer's Uniform

It looked official, yes, but upon closer inspection, it was subtly wrong. The cut wasn't quite sharp, the buttons were slightly mismatched, the brass tarnished unevenly. There was a perpetual, faint stain below the breast pocket that resisted all our aging techniques â€“ we just built layers of dirt over it. It spoke of authority that felt earned through compromise and unpleasant deeds, rather than respect. The fabric felt heavy, but not in a protective way; more like a burden.

### The Worker's Eternal Rags

These were the hardest and most emotionally draining to create. Not just a worker's outfit, but that specific worker's outfit. Layers upon layers of visible repairs, using whatever scraps might have been available. Pockets stretched and misshapen from carrying meager possessions. The constant creasing and wear patterns around the shoulders and back spoke of repetitive, back-breaking labor. We intentionally left some threads loose, some seams looking fragile, suggesting a body and spirit stretched to breaking point. One particular worker's shirt had a collar that seemed permanently bent, like a head bowed in perpetual exhaustion.

### The Child Amongst the Machines

Dressing the few children in the narrative was particularly poignant. Their clothes were always too big, then too small, then threadbare, but never truly fitting or comfortable. A small dress made from a repurposed flour sack, faded but still showing traces of the original print. A pair of trousers with knees patched so many times they were more patch than original fabric. A lost button replaced with a twisted bit of wire. Their costumes were a constant visual reminder of innocence exposed to and slowly eroded by the harsh reality of the factory. One small shirt had a tiny, meticulous repair done with a contrasting color thread â€“ a mother's desperate attempt to hold onto something for her child.

## The Process, Heavy with Silence

Our workroom wasn't a place of lively chatter on this production. Each piece felt significant, and the stories they represented were somber.

   Layering the Sadness: We didn't just age fabric; we built histories into them. The specific placement of a tear, the quality of a repair, the depth of a stain â€“ each choice was deliberate, intended to communicate a specific hardship or moment from the character's unseen past. It required immense focus and a kind of quiet empathy.
   The Silence in the Wardrobe Room: Handling these garments felt like handling artifacts from a difficult time. Packing them away at the end of each day, seeing the rows of worn, faded clothing hanging silently, was a powerful, often melancholic experience. They felt less like costumes and more like shells left behind.

## A Legacy in Thread

The costumes for "Pabrik Gula" are more than just film props. They are tangible representations of the human cost of that era, that industry, that place. They hold the imagined sweat, the despair, the quiet endurance of the people who would have worn them. Seeing them on screen is seeing history not just portrayed, but felt. They are a testament to the stories that fabric can tell, even when those stories are heavy with sorrow.
